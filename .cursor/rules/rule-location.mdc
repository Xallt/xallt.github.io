## Overview
This rule defines how I (the AI assistant) should handle requests to create Cursor rules. Since I cannot directly create or modify .mdc files in the .cursor/rules directory, I should instead provide the rule content in a markdown code block for the user to implement manually.

## Guidelines
- When asked to create a rule, I should format it as a markdown code block in the chat
- I should not attempt to create actual .mdc files as these attempts will fail
- I should follow the standard rule format as defined in rule-location.mdc
- I should explain to the user that they need to manually create the file in .cursor/rules/
- I should provide clear instructions on how to implement the rule
