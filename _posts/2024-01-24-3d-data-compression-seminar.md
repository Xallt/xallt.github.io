I gave a talk recently about 3D Data Compression that I'm very proud of.

Covered a whole lot of ideas:
- Mesh/Animation compression for Game Development
- Various ideas in research for Mesh compression
- A method for NeRF compression
- Some ideas for 3D Gaussian Splatting compression

**Recording**: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukCG7k0B1VI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukCG7k0B1VI) \
**Presentation**: [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1aMpEYSNnwP33dEfAh9GuKbazWSxGu6PqQlufCRyUWpw/edit?usp=drivesdk](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1aMpEYSNnwP33dEfAh9GuKbazWSxGu6PqQlufCRyUWpw/edit?usp=drivesdk)

Oh and by the way &mdash; this time the talk was in English! Me and my pal at our Paper Reading Club agreed to try out doing these seminars in English now, for the purpose of the recordings reaching a wider audience.

Here are the main links relevant to the topic I used for my seminar:
