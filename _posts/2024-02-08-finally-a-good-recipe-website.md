My favorite cooking YouTuber, [Ethan Chlebowski](https://www.youtube.com/@EthanChlebowski), has launched his vision of the perfect recipe website:

[https://www.cookwell.com/](https://www.cookwell.com/)

It feels like nobody had seriously tackled this before:

- Finally, there are no 15+ paragraphs of backstory/motivation behind each recipe, so you don't have to scroll for at least 5 seconds just to get to the ingredient list.
    
- There's a lot of material on the Science of Cooking, i.e., explanations of some basic principles behind each recipe. Ethan has centered his whole channel around popularizing all this science, and now he has created a corresponding companion website. Just take the [first recipe on the site](https://www.cookwell.com/recipe/double-steak-chipotle-bowl-homemade) â€” you can click on tags from the recipe and learn what [deglazing](https://www.cookwell.com/fundamental/technique/deglaze) or [marinating](https://www.cookwell.com/fundamental/technique/marinate) actually means. In short, the guy turned his cooking Zettelkasten into a full-fledged website.
    
- It's actually nice
    

The main problem that comes to my mind when I look at this is how much of a hassle it would be to update the website content... Adding tags to recipes, classifying each new ingredient into Pantry / Spices / Produce, etc. Makes me wonder whether he's creating it purely as a companion-site to the YT channel, or if he's planning to grow it into something more general-purpose. If so, a lot of automation would be needed, because imho people are too lazy to fill out all these things.

> Also in the [TG channel](https://t.me/boring_dont_look) someone commented about [based.cooking](https://based.cooking/) &mdash; a bloatless opensource cooking website. Also very interesting
