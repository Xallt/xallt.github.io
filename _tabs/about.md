![Me](/assets/img/me.jpg){: .right}{: w="200" }

Did competitive programming for 3 years, got very interested in Computer Graphics, Machine Learning, AR/VR.

First job was at [Funexpected](https://funexpectedapps.com/) where I was an Intern Godot Developer. I actually programmed most of the ninja-minigame in their Funexpected Math app! I was 16 at the time so that was quite a big deal for me.

Worked for 2 years at [3D Smile](https://3d-smile.ru/) part-time as a junior Machine Learning Engineer, working on an internal pipeline for teeth detection and segmentation.

Currently working at [Clostra](https://clostra.com/) as a full-time Machine Learning Engineer, working on various 3D Vision methods: depth estimation, NeRFs, 3D GANs, etc.

I am also currently pursuing my Bachelor's Degree studying **Applied Mathematics and Informatics** at the [Higher School of Economics](https://www.hse.ru/en/).
