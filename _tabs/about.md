![Me](/assets/img/me.jpg){: .right}{: w="200" }

Did competitive programming for 3 years, got very interested in Computer Graphics, Machine Learning, AR/VR.

Career:
- [Funexpected](https://funexpectedapps.com/) where I was an Intern Godot Developer. I actually programmed most of the ninja-minigame in their Funexpected Math app! I was 16 at the time.

- 2 years at [3D Smile](https://3d-smile.ru/) part-time as a Machine Learning Engineer, working on an internal pipeline for teeth detection and segmentation -- lots of R&D and some work on the internal ML infrastructure.

- 2 years at [Clostra](https://clostra.com/) as a full-time Machine Learning Engineer, working on various 3D Vision methods: depth estimation, NeRFs, 3D GANs, etc. . Most importantly, learned to stay on top of state-of-the-art research and constantly implement&test new stuff, and work with researchers' code.

- Worked for 4 months [Gracia AI](https://www.gracia.ai/) as an ML Research Engineer, improving the quality and efficiency of the photorealistic 3D captures.

- Currently working at Medida AI, making the work of national USA window manufacturers way easier with Computer Vision! (will share more on that later).
